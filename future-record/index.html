            Tourism is the temporary, short-term movement of people to destinations outside the places where they normally live and work and their activities during the stay at each destination. It includes movements for all purposes. In ancient times, leisure travel to places outside one's place of residence was restricted to the wealthy. They occasionally travelled to distant places to admire magnificent architecture and works of art, to learn a new language, to experience a new culture and to taste different cuisines. The earliest travel dates back to the Ur-King Shurji. <br>

            With the development of transport, from ships to trains, from yachts to planes, from maglev trains to rockets. The world has been moving rapidly towards global integration since the day transport was born, and today tourism has reached an advanced level. However, travel in the physical sense is often accompanied by several huge problems: firstly, the safety risks associated with transport; secondly, the high cost of travel, which is beyond the reach of the average family; and thirdly, the vulnerability to global viruses, such as the recent covid 19, which has devastated the travel industry and brought travel exchanges between countries to a virtual standstill.  <br>

            <br>
            <br>

            All of these disadvantages mean that the future of the travel industry will have to change, and two years after the impact of the epidemic, in 2021, the travel industry has started to plan for self-help. Virtual reality technology is now being used to offer tours to people trapped at home around the world, allowing them to see the local scenery and visit famous museums and zoos from home. In the future, the tourism industry is likely to be hit hard again by the environment, but virtual reality can save the day ...... <br>
